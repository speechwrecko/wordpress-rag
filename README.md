# Basic RAG implementation for Wordpress blogs

## Running Locally

Make sure you have Python installed

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/speechwrecko/wordpress-rag.git # or clone your own fork
$ cd wordpress-rag
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python app.py
```

Your app should now be running on [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000/).

## Required third party services

This project requires API access to several 3rd party services:

- Diffbot: https://app.diffbot.com/
- LLM (one or the other)
  - Anthropic: https://console.anthropic.com/dashboard
  - OpenAI: https://platform.openai.com/

note: the current scraper assumes you are using the Diffbot free version which only allows for 5 API calls per minute. If you have a paid account you can remove the 12 second sleep that exists in the code to rate limit calls to Diffbot.
